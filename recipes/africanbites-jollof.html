    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Jollof Rice, sometimes called jellof rice, is a classic rice dish cooked in a flavorful tomato-infused broth.
        With its several regional variations in name and ingredients, there is no absolute right or wrong way to cook
        this popular African rice recipe</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Rice â€“ The starchy base for our dish, this filling ingredient is generally fragrant and soaks a lot of
            water. I prefer basmati, but you can use any long-grain rice.</li>
        <li>Onions â€“ This veggie is excellent served fresh with its tangy flavor. However, I personally love it slightly
            caramelized for a bit of sweetness.</li>
        <li>Thyme â€“ A deliciously aromatic herb from the incredible mint family is a delicious addition to just about
            any savory recipe. Fresh is good, but dried will work, and I have a list of the perfect substitutes if you
            donâ€™t have thyme at all.</li>
        <li>Garlic â€“ Ah, the wonderful garlic flavor makes this Jollof Rice recipe even better.</li>
        <li>Paprika â€“ This ingredient adds the fabulous pepper flavor without the heat.</li>
        <li>Tomato Puree or Sauce â€“ The sweet, slightly acidic, and fresh flavors of tomato in a thick mixture is
            perfect for many starchy dishes.</li>
        <li>Chicken Broth (or water) â€“ Basically, the flavorful water that chicken was simmered in. Not only is it full
            of flavor, but itâ€™s also filled with healthy fats and collagen.</li>
        <li>Scotch Bonnet or Hot Pepper â€“ My favorite hot pepper is a tear-jerker, but sometimes a good cry is good for
            ya. ðŸ¤£ Most of the time, I put it whole instead of chopping it to get the flavor from its skin and not the
            seedâ€™s heat</li>
        <li>Vegetables â€“ Carrots, peas, green beans, and corn are all excellent choices to create a mix of colorful
            veggies to make it even more vibrant.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Add the Ginger and Garlic and cook along with the Tomato paste for another two minutes; Actually, by the
            time this ready, you will notice it in the smell. If you keep it cooking any longer you might risk burning
            them.</li>
        <li>Add my blended peppers. Usually, there is no particular time frame for frying this pepper. I often stop when
            the sauce becomes really thick and the oil literally floats on top of the sauce. At this point, most of the
            water is gone and the sauce no longer smells raw. Trust me you will know but just in case, you are still in
            doubt, I would say maybe 20 to 25 minutes depending on the quantity of water in your blended pepper.</li>
        <li>Finally, in building my flavor, I add the Thyme, Curry powder, Salt, white pepper (good but optional) and
            seasoning cubes. Adjust the seasoning at this point if there is a need to. Once the flavor is on point,
            then, I stir in my Rice. Make sure you stir the Rice properly until you cover each grain of Rice with the
            sauce. Now add the chicken stock. Give it a brief stir and cover it up with a tight-fitting lid. If your lid
            is not fitting enough, simply cover the rice with a foil paper before covering it with the lid. This is
            because Jollof needs a lot of steam in order to turn out well.</li>
        <li>Once, the rice comes to a boil, reduce the heat to medium-low immediately and continue to cook until the
            rice is done about 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
        <li>Serve with Fried Chicken, Spicy Grilled Chicken, Grilled Tilapia Fish or Gizzards and plantains.</li>
